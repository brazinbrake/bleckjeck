Not quite blackjack...but close enough?

Another prog developed using IntelliJ IDEA in Fedora 31, but features some exception catching and lots of user input loops with
a little back and forth fun with the dealer for good measure. 
Also a vector, a custom exception class, an extended class/method...Almost fully commented.

I don't know if this is the real way that a dealer plays, but this is how I recall the rules when I used to play with friends...
no doubling, no splitting, just hits and stands.

Player starts with $100. If they lose all money, the game ends. Otherwise they should be able to continue indefinitely if I got all the
shuffling correct (and they win)

I also read that you can use multiple decks, so I made that a thing, but I suppose that doens't make a difference unless you count cards

Have fun!
